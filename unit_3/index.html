		<h2>Peeps</h2>
			<p>Through my travels I have met some of the world's most inspiring people. Those who have lost and have perservered, and those who use their knowledge & abundant resources to create change in their community.</p>
		<h2>Places</h2>
			<p>They say the window to the soul is through travel, and I can attest to that. My belief is the world is much bigger than where you stand. If you never move from that spot, you'll never discover the opportunities that life has in store for you.</p>
		<h2>Things</h2>
			<p>I love trying new things. It's an incredible feeling to learn a new skill or hone in on one you're already really good at. My motto is "Do one thing every day that scares you."</p>
